 <br><font face="helvetica" color="black">Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy.<br>

 <br>Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, and the U.S.
 has some of the richest solar resources in the world. Modern technology can harness this energy for
 a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior
 environment, and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use.<br>

 <br>Solar panels turn the suns solar energy into electricity via photovoltaics. Photovoltaics allow
 electrons on the surface of a solar panel to be knocked loose by the incoming rays of the sun. These
 loose electrons create a direct current (DC) of electricity as they follow a pre-determined pathway
 on the solar panel. The DC electricity is then either stored in batteries, sent to the grid, or
 converted into alternating current (AC) using an inverter for use at the location.<br>
